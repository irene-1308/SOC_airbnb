    <h1 class="title"><strong>PROJECT REVIEW</strong></h1>

    <section class="main_text"> 


<p> This is a brief overview of how I approached this exercise. It was definitely a challenging (and exciting) task, and I’d love to do it again in November-December to see how much progress I’ve made.</p>

<p>In the beginning, I tried to break down the task into smaller ones so I could plan and ensure I finished on time. I made a few sketches to identify patterns and better understand the layout, and I also broke the screenshot down into its main elements (attaching some scans!).</p>

<p>I quickly realized that despite diligently completing all the pre-course exercises, I had a vague idea of how to start. I knew how to add photos to HTML and had a theoretical understanding of CSS layout, but I still felt I needed to do a lot of extra learning. I paid for the full Codecademy HTML and CSS courses, watched a few YouTube tutorials, and felt somewhat more confident, so I decided it was time to dive in.</p>

<p>One of the biggest issues for me was trying to work out how to use the Chrome Debugger. Honestly, I couldn't figure it out, so I added it to my list of things to learn later. I decided I would have to work it out myself and come up with my own icons, etc.</p>

<p>Another thing I struggled with (or should I say still struggle with?) is Git. I used drag and drop on GitHub as I had trouble using the branches via Terminal. While it wasn’t a big deal to add branches and files manually this time, I definitely want to get the hang of Git soon.</p>

<p>After checking the best practices guides, I made some changes to both HTML and CSS files. However, there were a couple of things that were not clear to me:
Many best practices didn’t make sense to me because I think I need to know more about HTML to understand all the rules. </p>

<p>One best practice I couldn't implement is to stop using CSS magic numbers. As stated in the guide, "it is indicative of either a poorly coded layout that requires this kind of manipulation, a lack of understanding of the box-model and layout, or both.” I am indeed guilty of both. I will keep this in mind and try my best to avoid using them in the future.</p>

<h3>What I Learned</h3>
    <ul>
        <li> Basic HTML commands: I think this is my main achievement. I understood the logic behind it and can write basic code myself without having to copy-paste.</li>
        <li>CSS commands: I learned the difference between justify/align items and what padding, border, and margin are.</li>
        <li> <strong> Always </strong> save your work before closing your laptop: Unfortunately, I learned this the hard way. </li>
</ul>
   
<h3> What I’d Do Differently*</h3>

<p>(*if I had twice the time or if I had to do the same exercise in a few months)</p>
    <ul>

        <li>Improve my CSS skills and avoid using magic numbers. </li>
        <li>Add more appropriate HTML elements (e.g., buttons). </li>
        <li>Gain a better understanding of the Chrome Debugger. </li>
        <li>Master Git terminal commands. </li>
    </ul>

<p> I would say that the "What I’d Do Differently" section could also be called my "To-Do List". Overall, I definitely enjoyed working on this exercise: trying to find the right approach, learning about various tools, and applying them.</p>
